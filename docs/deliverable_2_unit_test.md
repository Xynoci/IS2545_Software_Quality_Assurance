### CitySim9002

1. Top design. To fulfill [requirements](https://github.com/asphaltpanthers/IS2545/blob/master/deliverables/2/requirements.txt) given, at least three abstract classes should be defined: `Visitor`, `Location`, and `Generator`. Their subclasses respectively implement common methods defined to get their identity, including visitors' types and preferences, location types, and methods to generate different list.
2. Details. The requirements enlighten several specific features
    - In addition to types, preferences are also required by `Visitor`, which is a little bit complex than `Location`, which has no other features to be implemented except types. Based on this point, `Visitor` is implemented as a Class, and `Location` as an enum;
    - Random visitor list and location list are generated by the seed specified by user input, which should be passed into classes to keep consistency;
    - `null` in location list could be a flag value represents to exit the city, however, it cannot be the first destination of any visitor, which means a restriction required for the first run of iteration;
    - As long as `null` does not returned from the location generator, the visitor should keep visiting those places (, which s/he might visited thousands of times).
3. A conflict becomes even clear during testing process, which hasn't been a problem in previous development. That is the conflict of the expectations on access control from development perspective and test perspective. To be testable from other packages, some methods or variables that could be `private` need to be `public` and some classes that could be `protected` also need to be `public`. Even if some techniques enable us to test privates, then what kind of privates are need to be tested, and how deep should tests go still a problem. 

### Tests

#### Test concerns

1. Test granularity. In a more general scope, this concern is similar to the balancing concern between efficiency and over testing. Are tests expected on those "units" that designed to implement just a very naive functions, even sometimes the tested code is shorter than testing code needed? But rules should be there with experienced testers.
2. Test boundary. To identify value ranges is a good way to set restrict boundary on what are going to be mimicked and what are not.
3. Tests complexity. The complexity of tests should be minified to reduce the probability of introducing tests for tests :D

#### Assertions and stubs

Various assertions and stubs are applied in the tests. Test Suites is applied to organize them.
