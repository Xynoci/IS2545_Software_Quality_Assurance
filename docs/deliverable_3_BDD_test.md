### Tests

Thanks to this assignment I moved a little bit further on testing considerations, both into some practices and basic priciples. Besides, in order to automate the UI tests powered by [Selenuium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), I spent some time on configuring [Sauce Lab](https://saucelabs.com/) with it, through which I got some idea about corss-browser and cross-platform compatibility test. 

#### Principles

- **Unit tests should be isolated.** It comes from thoughts to the situation that the entire or part of one scenario/test could be preconditions for another. It IS an approach to write reuseable code, only if the test team has just one or very limited testers. Because maintain ordered test run could be a problem when group of testers are collaborating on the task or tests need to be run parallelly, which would be broken by dependencies added to them.
- **Tests should be small and atomic.** Small and atomic tests will make it easier to locate the origin of problems. If ralevant functions are tested in one test, then it will take more time to locate the broken part.

#### Practice
- Junit
  + Use `Assume` to define external assumptions: Unexpected situation happens, especially when tests rely on some external situations. However, tests shouldn't fail due to the unexpected external change. `Assume` handles it by skipping rather than failing the test;
- Cucumber
  + Write declarative scenarios: Scenarios shouldn't be influenced by changes in implementing details of functionalities, and also, scenarios need to be easy to read; 
  + One feature per file;
  + Group features files by file name prefix;
  + Group different type of Examples;

### User Stories and Scenarios

#### Feature: Login to the store

```cucumber
Feature: Login to the store
  As a user
  I would like to log in to my account
  So that I can ... (seems nothing on THE site ðŸ˜‚)

  Scenario Outline: Login to the store using valid and invalid credentials
    Given I'm about to "login"
    When I try to log in using <name> and <pass>
    Then I should see whether they are <valid> or not

    Examples: Valid credentials
      | name         | pass                | valid     |
      | "test@a"     | "$Q^)0%aWw*AVNLyG"  | "valid"   |
    Examples: Incorrect password
      | name         | pass                | valid     |
      | "test@a"     | "incorrectpassword" | "invalid" |
    Examples: Incorrect user name
      | name         | pass                | valid     |
      | "test@fake"  | "$Q^)0%aWw*AVNLyG"  | "invalid" |
```

#### Feature: Adding items to shopping cart

```cucumber
Feature: Adding items to shopping cart
  As a user
  I would like to add items to my shopping cart
  So that I can place my order later

  Background:
    Given I'm on "all products" page

  Scenario Outline: Adding one item to empty cart from 'All Product'
    When I try to add 1 <item>
    Then I should see total number is 1

    Examples:
      | item name        | item |
      | "iPhone 5"       | 32   |
      | "Magic Mouse"    | 40   |
      | "iPod Nano Blue" | 64   |

  Scenario Outline: Adding bunch of items to cart from 'All Product'
    Given <several> items already in the cart
    When I try to add <number> of items into the cart
    Then I navigate to "shopping cart"
      And I should see total number of items are <total>

    Examples: Items haven't been added before
      | several | number | total |
      | 0,0,1   | 1,1,0  | 1,1,1 |
    Examples: Items have been added before
      | several | number | total |
      | 0,1,1   | 1,1,0  | 1,2,1 |
      | 0,1,1   | 2,2,1  | 2,3,2 |

  Scenario Outline: Adding items to cart on different page
    Given I added <several> items to the cart
    Then I navigate to "home page"
    When I try to add <number> of items into the cart from home page
    Then I navigate to "shopping cart"
      And I should see total number of items are <total>

    Examples: Items haven't been added before
      | several | number | total |
      | 0,0,1   | 1,1,0  | 1,1,1 |
    Examples: Items have been added before
      | several | number | total |
      | 0,1,1   | 1,1,0  | 1,2,1 |
      | 0,1,1   | 2,2,1  | 2,3,2 |
```

#### Feature: Edit item information from shopping cart

```cucumber
Feature: Edit item information from shopping cart
  As a user
  I would like to change number of items to checkout in my shopping cart
  So that I can easily modify my order before checkout

  Background: # 2,1,1 for item 32, 40 and 64 respectively
    Given I got several items in cart
    And I'm about to checkout

  Scenario Outline: Remove items using remove button
    When I try to remove one <named item> from the list
    Then I should see the <named item> removed from the list
      And the rest except the removed <named item> are still there

    Examples: remove item
      | named item       | item |
      | "iPhone 5"       | 32   |
      | "Magic Mouse"    | 40   |
      | "iPod Nano Blue" | 64   |

  Scenario Outline: Modify amount of certain item
    When I modify the amount of <named item> as <number>
    Then I should see the amount of <named item> changed corresponding to the <number>
    And the rest except the modified <named item> are remains untouched

    Examples: reduce the amount (not to zero)
      | named item       | number |
      | "iPhone 5"       | 1      |
    Examples: reduced the amount to zero
      | named item       | number |
      | "Magic Mouse"    | 0      |
    Examples: reduced the amount to negative value
      | named item       | number |
      | "iPod Nano Blue" | -1     |
    Examples: add items
      | named item       | number |
      | "iPhone 5"       | 3      |
      | "Magic Mouse"    | 10     |
```

### Configs for local runs

The tests are currently run on *[Sauce Lab](https://saucelabs.com/)* using remote driver. Uncommenting the `initLocalDriver(driverType)` and commenting the `initRomoteDriver()` to run them on local.

```java
    // hw3.base.BaseGherkin
    protected void initDriver(int driverType) {
        //initLocalDriver(driverType);
        initRomoteDriver();
        wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 60);
    }
```
