### User Stories and Scenarios

#### Feature: Login to the store

```cucumber

    Examples: Incorrect password
      | name         | pass                | valid     |

```

### Configs for local runs

The tests are currently run on *[Sauce Lab](https://saucelabs.com/)* using remote driver. Uncommenting the `initLocalDriver(driverType)` and commenting the `initRomoteDriver()` to run them on local.

```java
    protected void initDriver(int driverType) {
        //initLocalDriver(driverType);
        initRomoteDriver();
        wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 60);
    }
```
