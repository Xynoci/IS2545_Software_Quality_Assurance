>Textbook: [A Friendly Introduction to Software Testing by Bill Laboon](https://github.com/laboon/software-testing/blob/master/software-testing-laboon-ebook.pdf)

>This course is designed to give the student a broad understanding of modern software testing and quality assurance. Topics covered will include: manual and automated testing, test driven and behavior driven development, performance testing, security testing, and testing strategy. Entire courses could be dedicated to any one of these topics. My goal is to introduce each topic and provide practical skills that are used in the industry.

#### [Deliverables 3](https://github.com/asphaltpanthers/IS2545/blob/master/deliverables/3/deliverable3.md)

>For this assignment, you will write systems-level, automated black-box tests for a e-commerce [website](http://store.demoqa.com/) using the *BDD model* discussed in class. That is, you will write user stories (features) and scenarios, and then use JUnit and Selenium tests.

>   - There shall be 3 (three) user stories, and a total of at least 9 scenarios;
>   - User stories should all follow the Connextra (as a/i would like to/so that) template. Scenarios should all follow the Given/When/Then template;
>   - All tests shall correspond to a scenario and vice-versa. There should be one test class per user story.
